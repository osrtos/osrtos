### Features

- POSIX 1003.1b API including threads.
- VMEbus Industry Trade Association RTEID/ORKID based Classic API (similar to pSOS+).
- TCP/IP including BSD Sockets. Choice of high performance port of FreeBSD TCP/IP stack or LwIP.
- GNU Toolset Supports Multiple Language Standards. Multitasking capabilities.
- Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP) on ARM, AArch64, PowerPC, RISC-V, SPARC, and x86.
- Homogeneous and heterogeneous multiprocessor systems. Event-driven, priority-based pre-emptive scheduling.
- Optional rate-monotonic scheduling. Intertask communication and synchronization.
- Priority inheritance.
- Responsive interrupt management.
- Dynamic memory allocation.
- High level of user configurability.
- Portable to many target environments.
- POSIX standard file system semantics.
- GNU debugger. DDD GUI interface to gdb.
- Self-hosted debugging on AArch64, ARM, i386, Microblaze, PowerPC
- Loadable modules on AArch64, ARM, Blackfin, i386, lm32, m68k, Microblaze, MIPS, Moxie, PowerPC, RISC-V, SPARC, v850
