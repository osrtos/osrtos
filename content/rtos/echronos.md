The eChronos RTOS is a real-time operating system (RTOS) originally developed by NICTA and Breakaway Consulting Pty. Ltd. It is intended for tightly resource-constrained devices without memory protection.

### Features

- It is intended for tightly resource-constrained devices without memory protection. To this end, the RTOS code base is designed to be highly modular and configurable on multiple levels, so that only the minimal amount of code necessary is ever compiled into a given system image.

### Sample projects and resources
<!--github-projects-->
- [echronos-on-STM32F4x-Nucleo-board](https://github.com/Daparrag/echronos-on-STM32F4x-Nucleo-board). This repository contain an example of echronos RTOS running on the STM32f4-Nucleo Board.
