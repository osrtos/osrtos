CMSIS is a set of tools, APIs, frameworks, and workflows designed to simplify software re-use, reduce the learning curve for microcontroller developers, and accelerate project build and debug processes. It was initiated as a vendor-independent hardware abstraction layer for Arm® Cortex®-M based processors and later expanded to support entry-level Arm Cortex-A based processors. CMSIS aims to provide a consistent approach to interface with peripherals, real-time operating systems, and middleware components.
