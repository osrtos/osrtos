TizenRT is a lightweight RTOS (Real-Time Operating System) designed to support low-end IoT devices. It aims to extend the Tizen platform device coverage to devices like home appliances without display and wearable bands with a small LCD. These devices are typically equipped with Cortex-M/R processors with MPU, less than 2 MB RAM, and less than 16 MB Flash.

### Features

- **RTOS-based Platform**: Specifically designed for low-end IoT devices.
- **IPv6 Support**: Includes support for Neighbor Discovery (ND6), Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD), and ICMPv6 protocols.
- **Docker Build Environment**: Provides an easy way to build using Docker, eliminating the need for manual library and toolchain installations.
- **Media Framework**: Offers player/recorder functionalities for voice/audio streaming.
- **Task Manager Framework**: Enables control and messaging between applications.
- **Network Monitoring Tool**: Monitors real-time information regarding network sockets, network interface, and WiFi Manager.
- **gRPC for Client Roles**: Supports various RPC types and both insecure and secure modes of RPC execution.
- **HTTP/2 Support**: Ported nghttp2 version 1.32.0 from Github.

### Components

- **Kernel and System**: Provides features like stack trace in text, new pthread_tryjoin_np API, and Docker build environment.
- **Network and Connectivity**: Offers IPv6 support, network monitoring tools, gRPC for client roles, and HTTP/2.
- **Framework**: Includes a media framework, voice control manager, task manager framework, and Wi-Fi manager framework.
- **External**: Incorporates libc++, protocol buffer, cURL, and a stress test tool.
