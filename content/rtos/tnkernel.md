TNKernel is a compact and very fast real-time kernel for the embedded 32/16/8 bits microprocessors.

<!--more-->

### Features
- Includes semaphores, mutexes, data queues, event flags and fixed-sized memory pools. The system performs a preemptive priority-based scheduling and a round-robin scheduling for the tasks with identical priority.
- TNKernel is a fully portable (it is written mostly in ANSI C except the processor-specific parts) and was ported for the 8/16/32bits MCUs.
- On TNKernel site, you also can find an another projects, that are usable for the embedded systems design - TCP/IP stack, USB bulk firmware etc.
