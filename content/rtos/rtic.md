RIOT, the hardware accelerated Rust RTOS. A concurrency framework for building real-time systems.

<!--more-->

### Features

- Tasks as the unit of concurrency 1. Tasks can be event triggered (fired in response to asynchronous stimuli) or spawned by the application on demand.
- Message passing between tasks. Specifically, messages can be passed to software tasks at spawn time.
- A timer queue 2. Software tasks can be scheduled to run at some time in the future. This feature can be used to implement periodic tasks.
- Support for prioritization of tasks and, thus, preemptive multitasking.
- Efficient and data race free memory sharing through fine-grained priority based critical sections 1.
- Deadlock free execution guaranteed at compile time. This is a stronger guarantee than what's provided by the standard Mutex abstraction.
- Minimal scheduling overhead. The task scheduler has minimal software footprint; the hardware does the bulk of the scheduling.
- Highly efficient memory usage: All the tasks share a single call stack and there's no hard dependency on a dynamic memory allocator.
- All Cortex-M devices are fully supported.
- This task model is amenable to known WCET (Worst Case Execution Time) analysis and scheduling analysis techniques.
