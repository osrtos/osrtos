Drone is an Embedded Operating System for writing real-time applications in Rust.

<!--more-->

It aims to bring modern development approaches without compromising performance into the world of embedded programming.

### Features

- Energy effective from the start. Drone encourages interrupt-driven execution model.
- Hard Real-Time. Drone relies on atomic operations instead of using critical sections.
- Fully preemptive multi-tasking with strict priorities. A higher priority task takes precedence with minimal latency.
- Highly concurrent. Multi-tasking in Drone is very cheap, and Rust ensures it is also safe.
- Message passing concurrency. Drone ships with synchronization primitives out of the box.
- Single stack by default. Drone concurrency primitives are essentially stack-less state machines. But stackful tasks are still supported.
- Dynamic memory enabled. Drone lets you use convenient data structures like mutable strings or vectors while still staying deterministic and code efficient.
- Async/await by default. Drone provides all required run-time to use native async/await syntax and execute Futures.
- Doesn’t require unsafe code. In spite of the fact that Drone core inevitably relies on unsafe code, Drone applications can fully rely on the safe abstractions provided by Drone.
- Modern tooling. Apart from standard Rust tools like cargo package manager, rustfmt code formatter, clippy code linter, Drone provides drone command-line utility which can generate a new Drone project for your hardware, or manage your debug probe.
- Primary stack is stack-overflow protected regardless of MMU/MPU presence. But secondary stackful tasks require MMU/MPU to ensure the safety.
- Debug communication channels. Rust’s print!, eprint! and similar macros are mapped to Cortex-M’s ITM channels 0 and 1 out of the box. Debug messages incur no overhead when no debug probe is connected.
- Drone.toml configuration file, which saves you from manually writing linker scripts.
- Rich and safe zero-cost abstractions for memory-mapped registers. Drone automatically generates register bindings from vendor-provided SVD files. It also provides a way to write code generic over similar peripherals.
